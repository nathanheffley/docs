## Package Development

If you have PHP and Composer installed on your local machine you should be able to easily run the PHPUnit test suite.

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If you prefer to run the tests within a Docker container, this project includes
[Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail).

To install the dependencies:

```
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/opt \
    -w /opt \
    laravelsail/php80-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

docker-compose up -d
```

```
sail exec laravel.test ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
